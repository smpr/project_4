<h3>Personal Struggles:</h3><br />
<p>With this project I set out to achieve a better understanding of utilizing different external API's inside of my application. I did this by making server side calls to keep everything a little more secure. The initial grasp of this was slightly overwhelming due to less than helpful documentation of said API's and the hours and hours of walkthroughs some users made.</p>
<h3>Technology Used:</h3><br />
<p>I decided to go with React on Rails do to the relationship of my data to each other and my plans on expanding many thoughts on it. React was used due to the ammount of user interaction. I used the Meetup API because of its relavance to the categories being made. I then decided to bring in google maps to show the Meetup location. This was easy due to the MeetUp API sending the longitude and latitude with the data. My login was handled with devise. </p>
